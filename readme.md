. This is basically a code sample to demonstrate dependency injection, types of DI and it's advantages.  <br/>
. The code in the package com.di.nodi contains non-dependency injection code.  <br/>
. Code in com.di.constructorinjection contains dependency injection code using constructor DI.  <br/>
. And code in com.di.setterinjection contains setter based DI code.  <br/>
. Basically, the code in the all the three packages mentioned above are trying code implementations for the same problem using non-di, const-based di and setter-based di techniques.  <br/>
. Detailed explanation of the flow is documented in the word doc.  <br/>  
. Ofcourse, the di example in this project do not use any di frameworks like spring. <br/>
